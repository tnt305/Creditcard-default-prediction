# Creditcard-defaut-prediction
This project included 2 part:
- The first is creditcard prediction using basic approach of visualizing and drop useless features. Updating on 20 March, there existed an errors while creating dummies,i did fall into trap dummies. What should have done was dropping the dummy with smallest effect on the model corresponding to each feature.
- Another one is trying to feature importance features by using WoE and IV approaches then model using PD-PDG and EAD. This second one is still an in progress project.
